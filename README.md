# Add-details
This projects takes up data from user and simply displays them in a formatted manner. I crated this project to learn more about jQuery

I have build a web page that takes student data and then enter a new record into a list on that same page.
All the fields are necessary to be filled and the addition of a new record is directly visible on the screen. An alert is displayed if fileds are left empty.
